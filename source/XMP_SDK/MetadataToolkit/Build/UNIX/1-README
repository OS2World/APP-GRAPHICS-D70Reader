  You only need to do this if new files are added, existing
  files are removed, or include file dependencies change.

  1. Login to a machine running Solaris 2.6
  
  2. Make sure depends.mak is checked out of Perforce for edit:

     cd $TOP/SDK/MetadataToolkit/Build/UNIX
     /public/bin/p4 edit depends.mak

  3. Remake dependency file:

     cd $TOP/SDK/MetadataToolkit/Build/UNIX
     make sparcsolaris debug depend

  4. Check in the new depends.mak to perforce:

     cd $TOP/SDK/MetadataToolkit/Build/UNIX
     /public/bin/p4 submit
