Louis,

It is all about the data that is embedded in each image you take with the
D70, or any other digital camera.  The D70Reader will extract that data in
readable form, from the image file.  Photoshop also does this, but it also
likes to drop some of it on the floor!  In using Photoshop CS, I was not
able to find a way to cut and paste the information. I could not do this, so
that I could send it in an email message, etc.  I ended up transferring the
data by re-typing it.  That is why I originally wrote the program.

Here is an example of EXIF data taken directly from the camera in a NEF
image:

D70ReaderProgramVersion    : 0.18

Here is the EXIF data after being processed by Adobe Photoshop CS:

D70ReaderProgramVersion    : 0.17
Filename                   : DSC_0001.JPG
Make                       : NIKON CORPORATION

ExifImageLength            : 2000
FocalLengthIn35mmFilm      : 105mm

Notice all the data that is missing!

Now, Adobe Photoshop CS embeds XMP data for the above image, and the
D70Reader can dump it, along with the above data:

D70ReaderProgramVersion    : 0.18
Filename                   : DSC_0001.JPG
Make                       : NIKON CORPORATION
Model                      : NIKON D70
Orientation                : Horizontal (normal)
Software                   : Adobe Photoshop CS Windows
ExposureTime               : 1/200 seconds
FNumber                    : 7.100000
ISOSpeedRatings            : 200
ExposureBiasValue          : 0.000000
MeteringMode               : Multi-segment
Flash                      : No Flash
FocalLength                : 70mm
ExifImageWidth             : 3008
ExifImageLength            : 2000
FocalLengthIn35mmFilm      : 105mm
WhiteBalance               : As Shot
DateTimeDigitized          : 2005:02:03 10:00:31
FlashMode                  :
FlashSetting               : NORMAL
ColorMode                  : Unknown
Lens                       : 18.0-70.0 mm f/3.5-4.5

But, as you see, it is still missing some of the original EXIF data!

The D70Reader can dump the full XMP data stream:

But again, it is not all of the original EXIF data, from the original NEF
file.

Now, the D70Reader gives you a number of options.  You may not be interested
in any of them.  But, some people will be.  Here is a list:

Format:
	d70reader [-h|-v|-w|-x|-j|-c|-js] image_file_name

	d70reader [-h|-v|-w|-x|-j|-c|-js] *.NEF *.JPG

	-h  = this screen
	-v  = verbose (raw data)
	-w  = generate HTML table
	-x  = generate XML tree
	-j  = extract JPG thumbnail image from NEF
	-c  = generate Comma Separated Values (CSV) data
	-js = generate JavaScript Array data

The -v option will allow you to see the raw data (like the XMP data above).

The -w option will generate an HTML table of the data, that can be embedded
in a web site.

The -x option will generate an XML data tree of the data.  This is useful
for only certain situations.

The -j option will extract the JPG thumbnail image from the NEF image file.
With the D70Reader, you can process a whole directory of NEF image files, in
a very short time, and extract the JPG images.  The images will be
automatically rotated, for proper display.  This means that you do not have
to shoot RAW + JPG anymore, and put more images on you CF card.

The -c option generates CSV data.  This can be imported into a spreadsheet,
or a database, so that you can keep track of your image data.

The -js option will allow you to create JavaScript array data, that can be
used to create a web based slideshow of your images.

I hope this explains what this program is all about.

Jon
