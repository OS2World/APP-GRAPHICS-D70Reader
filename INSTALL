==========================================================================
If you have Slackware 10.0, just copy the ./bin/d70reader program into 
a directory of your choice (example);

/usr/local/bin

You should be logged on as 'root' to do the file copy, here are the steps:

.  su root
.  cp ./bin/d70reader /usr/local/bin
.  chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/d70reader
.  d70reader image_file_name	#Note:  This step is required to properly create the configuration file
.  exit

==========================================================================
To make the application on your system, do this:

cd ./source
./make_all_rotate
cd ..

copy the ./bin/d70reader program to a directory of your choice (example):

/usr/local/bin

You should be logged on as 'root' to do the file copy, here are the steps:

.  su root
.  cp ./bin/d70reader /usr/local/bin
.  chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/d70reader
.  d70reader image_file_name	#Note:  This step is required to properly create the configuration file
.  exit

For developers:

If you do not like the default location of the d70reader.conf file,
you can over-ride the location by making a change in the d70config.h
file.  Check out the notes there.
